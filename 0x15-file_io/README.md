# Low-Level Programming - C Project

This project includes several tasks that involve working with low-level programming concepts in the C language. Each task focuses on different aspects of file handling, system calls, and data manipulation.

## Task 0: Read and Print Text File

The goal of this task is to create a function `read_textfile` that reads a specified number of letters from a text file and prints them to the standard output. The function should return the actual number of letters read and printed. If the file cannot be opened or read, or if the filename is NULL, the function should return 0.

## Task 1: Create a File

In this task, the function `create_file` is implemented to create a file with a given filename and write a specified text content to it. The function should return 1 on success and -1 on failure. If the text content is NULL, an empty file should be created.

## Task 2: Append Text to a File

The `append_text_to_file` function is designed to append a provided text content to the end of an existing file. If the file does not exist, the function should return -1. Otherwise, it should return 1 on success and handle write failures or permissions issues.

## Task 3: Copy the Content of a File to Another File

The goal of this task is to create a program `cp` that copies the content of one file to another file. The program takes two arguments, the source file and the destination file. It handles cases where the files do not exist, permissions issues, and truncation of the destination file.

## Task 4: Display ELF Header Information

This task involves creating a program `elf_header` that displays information contained in the ELF header of an ELF file. The program reads the ELF header and prints details such as the magic number, class, data format, version, OS/ABI, ABI version, type, and entry point address.

Each task has its own set of requirements and constraints outlined in the project description. The code adheres to the given guidelines, and header files are provided for each task to ensure modularity and clarity.

Please make sure to replace the descriptions with accurate and detailed information about each task as per your project's actual content.
